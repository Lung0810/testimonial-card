          cards. Testimonials are quotes or statement from satisfied customers
          or users, often used on website to build credibility and trust.

          The godl of this project is to teach you about position and layout in
          CSS. Below is rough mockup showing some testimonial cards. Each card

          I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior
          developers. It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career.

          roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it
          during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single
          repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much impact it
          has had on millions of lives since then.
